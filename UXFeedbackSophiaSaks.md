  1.  ✔ look at the fontsize and margins on the topbar, contact looks a lot bigger and the margins are a bit off it seems like? 

  2.  ✔ I would like the navbar to be sticky so i can use it even as i scroll down 

  3.  ✔ maybe the margins a bit smaller for the navbar too? now your name is pretty "far into" it, like put it more out to the left and so on? 

  4.  i dont understand why there are two rows where you filter the projects ? :joy:

  5.  i honestly think the arrows up and down are kinda unnecessary, its way faster to scroll and like its COOL but the sections are so small that i dont think it adds anything

  6.  would put some more top and bottom margin in the little white boxes in the tech section

  7.  ✔ would make the hamburger menu a bit bigger in the smaller screen view

  8.  ✔ when you click the hamburger menu, usually the menu doesnt cover the whole screen but its more of a sidebar, i think it will look better too when its less wide

  9.  i would put a little bit of a blur over the second background, right now it steals too much attention, and maybe even some more on the first background too

  10.  i would be a little bit more bold with separating the sections, right now on the tech one its just a title in a sliiightly smaller font, and the second one for projects has a more marked out title but is kinda floating around a bit more.

### 6:

i would honestly PREFER the navbar, and making it sticky and removing the arrows all together so you just use the navbar to navigate the page but thats pretty subjective, but i think thats like more clear

Mmm... maybe arrows for mobile, but Navbar for desktop/tablet? I disklike scrolling to much on a phone, but that might just be m

### 10:

Mm... so bigger header font-sizes and margins? Or some border, maybe shadows?

yes, OR some other way to show that its the title and separate stuff, you can go creative with that if you want to like a banner with the title or schtuff like that
